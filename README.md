# Blog Post:Run PyFlink Jobs and UDFs on Ververica Platform

The accompanying code repo for the blog post above.

## What's included
The post goes over creating a new custom Flink image to be used instead of
the out-of-the-box image, in order to run PyFlink jobs and call python based UDF functions
in either pythong or java Jobs.

* __Custom image Dockerfile__: In the custom_image directory
* __Java Table API Job and UDF__: The directory "java_python_udf " contains the source code for a 
sample Java TableAPI job that declares and calls a UDF function written in Python. 
The source code and POM of the job can be found in the "job" folder. The POM file already contains
the pyflink dependency and is ready to go, if you'd like to package up the project JAR. The python UDF file can be found in the "udf" folder.
*  __PyFlink Job__: The "pyflink" directory contains the pyflink JAR dependency in the "dependencies" folder and the "basic_operations.py" job.
